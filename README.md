Project to:

  1. Convert 2 terabyte iTunes database to easier to work with CouchDB database.
  2. Build savvy playlists by updating iPod database directly.

Unlike iTunes "smart" playlists, savvy playlists will allow for collation,
staggering, bias-weighting and on-the-fly de-duplication of playlists.

== Requirements ==

requires libgpod -- http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod/

This appears to be the most up-to-date version

Note that this is entirely unrelated to the "GPOD" module on pip.
